Description: The multiDEGGs package performs multi-omic differential network 
      analysis by revealing differential interactions between molecular entities
      (genes, proteins, miRNAs, or other biomolecules) across the omic datasets
      provided. For each omic dataset, a differential network is constructed where
      links represent statistically significant differential interactions between 
      entities. These networks are then integrated into a comprehensive visualization
      using distinct colors to distinguish interactions from different omic layers.
      This unified display allows interactive exploration of cross-omic
      patterns, such as differential interactions present at both transcript and
      protein levels. For each link, users can access differential statistical 
      significance metrics (p-values or adjusted p-values, calculated via robust or 
      traditional linear regression with interaction term) and differential regression
      plots.
