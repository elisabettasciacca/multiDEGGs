Description: Performs multi-omic differential network 
      analysis by revealing differential interactions between molecular entities
      (genes, proteins, transcription factors, or other biomolecules) across the
      omic datasets provided. 
      For each omic dataset, a differential network is constructed where
      links represent statistically significant differential interactions between 
      entities. These networks are then integrated into a comprehensive visualization
      using distinct colors to distinguish interactions from different omic layers.
      This unified display allows interactive exploration of cross-omic
      patterns, such as differential interactions present at both transcript and
      protein levels. For each link, users can access differential statistical 
      significance metrics (p values or adjusted p values, calculated via robust or 
      traditional linear regression with interaction term) and differential regression
      plots.  
      The methods implemented in this package are described in Sciacca et al. (2023)
      <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btad192>.
