# Boxplots of single nodes (genes,proteins, etc.)

This function is for internal use of `View_diffnetworks`

## Usage

``` r
node_boxplot(gene, assayDataName = 1, deggs_object)
```

## Arguments

- gene:

  gene name (must be in `rownames(assayData)`)

- assayDataName:

  name of the assayData of interest. If an unnamed list of data was
  given to `get_diffNetworks`, the assayDataName here will be the number
  indicating the position of the data in the assayDataList provided
  before (i.e. if the user wants to plot a differential interaction
  observed in the transcriptomic data, which was second in the list,
  then assayDataName must be 2, if only one data table was provided
  assayDataName must be 1). Default 1.

- deggs_object:

  an object of class `deggs` generated by `get_diffNetworks`

## Value

the boxplot
