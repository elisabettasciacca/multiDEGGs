<p>The multiDEGGs package performs multi-omic differential network analysis by 
showing differential interactions between molecular entities (genes, proteins, 
miRNAs, or other biomolecules) across the omic datasets provided.</p>

<p>For each omic dataset, a differential network is constructed, where links 
represent statistically significant differential interactions between entities. 
These networks are then integrated into a comprehensive visualization using 
distinct colors to distinguish interactions from different omic layers.</p>

<p>This unified visualization allows interactive exploration of cross-omic patterns 
(e.g., differential interactions present at both transcript and protein level). 
For each link, users can access differential statistical significance metrics 
(p-values or adjusted p-values, calculated via robust or traditional linear 
regression with interaction term), and differential regression plots.</p>

## Installation

multiDEGGs can be installed from GitHub using devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github("elisabettasciacca/multiDEGGs")
```

## Getting Started

Let's start by loading the package and sample data:

```{r load_data}
library(multiDEGGs)
data("synthetic_metadata")
data("synthetic_rnaseqData")
data("synthetic_proteomicData")
data("synthetic_OlinkData")
```

## Generate Differential Networks

```{r}
assayData_list <- list("RNAseq" = synthetic_rnaseqData,
                       "Proteomics" = synthetic_proteomicData,
                       "Olink" = synthetic_OlinkData)

deggs_object <- get_diffNetworks(assayData = assayData_list,
                                 metadata = synthetic_metadata,
                                 category_variable = "response",
                                 regression_method = "lm",
                                 padj_method = "bonferroni",
                                 verbose = FALSE,
                                 show_progressBar = FALSE,
                                 cores = 2)
```

### Key Parameters of `get_diffNetworks`

It's worth explaining some of the important parameters of `get_diffNetworks`:

* `assayData`: accepts either a single normalized matrix/data frame (for single 
  omic differential analysis), or a list of matrices/data frames (for multi-omic 
  scenarios). For multi-omic analysis, it's highly recommended to use a named 
  list of data. If unnamed, sequential names (assayData1, assayData2, etc.) will 
  be assigned to identify each matrix or data frame.

* `metadata`: can also be a named factor vector, with names matching the patient 
  IDs in column names of the assay data matrices/data frames. In that case, the 
  category_variable can remain unset (NULL by default).

* `category_subset`: this parameter can restrict the analysis to a certain 
  subset of categories available in the metadata/category vector.

* `regression_method`: set to `"lm"` by default because it is faster and highly 
  recommended in machine learning scenarios, where the function might be 
  repeatedly called many times. For basic differential analyses, `"rlm"` can 
  also be used and may perform better in some cases.

* `percentile_vector`: by default, molecular targets (genes, proteins, etc.) 
  whose expression level is below the 35th percentile of the entire data matrix 
  are excluded from the analysis. This threshold can be modified by specifying 
  the percentile vector that is internally used for the percolation analysis. 
  For example, to remove only targets below the 25th percentile, set 
  `percentile_vector = seq(0.25, 0.98, by = 0.05)`.

* `padj_method`: the default method is Bonferroni. Storey's q values often give 
  more generous results but the `qvalue` package needs to be installed first.

**NOTE**: Not all patient IDs need to be present across datasets. Different 
numbers of samples per omic are acceptable. Only IDs whose data is available in 
the colnames of the assayData will be included in the analysis. Missing IDs will 
be listed in a message similar to:

`The following samples IDs are missing in Proteomics: PT001, PT005, PT0030`

## Visualization

The `deggs_object` now contains the differential networks for each omic data
in `assayData_list`. These networks can be integrated into a comprehensive 
visualization where different colors distinguish links from different omic 
layers.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View_diffNetworks(deggs_object)
``` 

This visualization interface allows you to:

1. Navigate the networks associated with each patient category
2. Filter by link significance
3. Search for specific genes inside the network

<p>&nbsp;</p>
![](multiDEGGs_1.png){width=60%}
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

Thicker links correspond to higher significant p-values.  
The direction of the 
arrows shows the relationship direction reported in literature, not derived from 
the data.

The user can visualize differential regression plots by clicking on a link:

Single node differential expressions can also be visualized by clicking on the 
nodes:

**NOTE**: For multi-omic scenarios, the data from the first matrix in the list 
passed to `assayData` will be used for this boxplot.

## List All Differential Interactions

Outside of the interactive environment, the `get_multiOmics_diffNetworks()` 
function can be used to get a table of all differential interactions, ordered by 
p-value or adjusted p-value:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
get_multiOmics_diffNetworks(deggs_object, sig_threshold = 0.05)
```
  
For single omic scenarios, use the `get_sig_deggs()` function:

```{r}
deggs_object_oneOmic <- get_diffNetworks(assayData = synthetic_rnaseqData,
                                 metadata = synthetic_metadata,
                                 category_variable = "response",
                                 regression_method = "lm",
                                 padj_method = "bonferroni",
                                 verbose = FALSE,
                                 show_progressBar = FALSE,
                                 cores = 2)

get_sig_deggs(deggs_object_oneOmic, sig_threshold = 0.05)
```

## Differential Regression Plots 

To plot the differential regression fits outside of the interactive environment, 
use `plot_regressions()` specifying the omic data to be used and the two targets:
  
```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.5}
plot_regressions(deggs_object,
                 assayDataName = "RNAseq",
                 gene_A = "MTOR", 
                 gene_B = "AKT2",
                 legend_position = "bottomright")
```
  
In single omic analyses, the `assayDataName` parameter can remain unset.

## Differential Network Analysis with More Than Two Groups 

It's possible to compare differential interactions among more than two 
categorical groups. All steps described above stay the same;  
the dropdown 
menu of the interactive environment will show all available categories:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="multiDEGGs_4.png" width="100%"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

while regressions and boxplots will show all categories:  

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="multiDEGGs_5.png" width="100%"/></td>
    <td><img src="multiDEGGs_6.png" width="100%"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The statistical significance of the interaction term is calculated via one-way 
ANOVA in this case.  
We highly recommend to have at least 4 or 5 observations per group.

## Using multiDEGGs for Feature Selection in Machine Learning with nestedCV

Detecting differentially expressed interactions is useful for gaining insights 
into molecular dysregulations affecting certain conditions. This information can 
also be leveraged to train predictive models for the category of interest.

While some models, such as glmnet, allow for sparsity and have built-in variable
selection, many models fail to fit when given massive numbers of predictors, or 
perform poorly due to overfitting. In medicine, one of the common goals of 
predictive modeling is the development of diagnostic or biomarker tests, for 
which reducing the number of predictors is typically a practical necessity.  
<b> The 
differential molecular interactions found with multiDEGGs can be used to filter 
down the number of predictors. </b>

However, filtering predictors on the whole dataset creates information leakage 
about the test set, leading to overly optimistic performance assessments 
(Vabalas et al., 2019).  
Feature selection should be considered an integral part 
of a model, with selection performed only on training data. Then the selected 
features and accompanying model can be tested on hold-out test data without 
bias.

While most machine learning pipelines involve splitting data into training and 
testing cohorts (typically 2/3 and 1/3 respectively), medical datasets may be 
too small for this approach, resulting in accuracy determination problems, due
tosmall test sets. Nested cross-validation (CV) provides a way to address this by 
maximizing use of the whole dataset for testing overall accuracy, while 
maintaining the split between training and testing.

As mentioned earlier, <b> it is important that any filtering of predictors is 
performed within the CV loops to prevent test data information leakage. </b> 
For this 
reason, we demonstrate how to use multiDEGGs in combination with the nestedCV 
package, where filtering can be applied to each outer CV training fold (see also 
the `nestedCV` vignette).

### Modification of Predictors 

The core idea behind multiDEGGs is that the interaction between two molecular 
entities can provide additional information beyond the expression of individual 
molecular entities. In machine learning terms, this suggests that combinations 
of certain predictors may carry more information than individual predictor data.

Therefore, we propose using multiDEGGs not only to select predictors involved in 
differential interactions but also to create new predictors based on 
combinations of the original ones. These relationships can be modeled by adding 
new predictors as combinations of pairs of original predictors (e.g., 
multiplication, ratio, etc.).

To evaluate the performance of the resulting trained model, these combined 
predictors must also be added to the test set. The nestedCV package allows 
integration of predictor modification into the CV loop, enabling modification of 
both training and test sets separately, avoiding data leakage.

The first step is to define a custom filtering function that extracts the 
differential nodes and links from the selected fold:
    
```{r}
# Convert metadata into a named factor vector containing only the labels to 
# predict (to ensure compatibility with the nestedCV functions)
metadata_vector <- as.factor(synthetic_metadata[, "response"])

# Make sure the assay data you want to use for prediction is a matrix and
# transpose it, so features are in columns 
# (standard format for machine learning)
assayData <- as.matrix(t(synthetic_rnaseqData))

# NOTE: Make sure your vector is ALIGNED with assayData. 
# The order of the annotations in the metadata_vector must match the 
# samples in the rows of assayData

# Remove zero variance columns from data
assayData <- assayData[,apply(assayData, 2, var, na.rm=TRUE) != 0] 

# define a filtering function that extracts differential nodes and links
# using multiDEGGs:
DEGGs_modxy <- function(metadata, assayData, ...) {
  counts <- t(assayData)
  names(metadata_vector) <- rownames(assayData)
  
  deggs_object <- multiDEGGs::get_diffNetworks(
    assayData = counts,
    metadata = metadata_vector,
    percentile_vector = seq(0.25, 0.98, by = 0.05),
    use_qvalues = TRUE, 
    show_progressBar = FALSE,
    verbose = FALSE,
    cores = 1
  )
  
  pairs <- multiDEGGs::get_sig_deggs(deggs_object, 1, 0.05)
  
  # Take genes 2 by 2 from top pairs to lower ones
  keep_DEGGs <- unique(unlist(lapply(1:nrow(pairs), function(i) {
    row_n = c(pairs[i,1], pairs[i,2])
  })))
  
  # The following could be added if you want to set a maximum number of 
  # predictors to be selected: 
  # if (length(keep_DEGGs) > 50) {    # take only top 50 predictors 
  #   keep_DEGGs <- keep_DEGGs[1:50]
  #   pairs <- pairs[which(pairs$var1 %in% keep_DEGGs & 
  #                        pairs$var2 %in% keep_DEGGs), ]
  # }
  
  out <- list(keep_DEGGs = keep_DEGGs, pairs = pairs)
  class(out) <- "DEGGs_modxy"
  return(out)
}
```

Next, define a predict function that specifies how to modify the train and test 
set predictors based on the filtering:
  
```{r}
# This custom predict function will add new columns to x (can be train or test)
predict.DEGGs_modxy <- function(DEGGs.object, newdata, filter = TRUE, 
                                interaction.type = "ratio",
                                sep = ":", ...) {
  if (length(DEGGs.object$keep) != 0) {
    pairs <- DEGGs.object$pairs
    x2a <- newdata[, pairs[, 1], drop = FALSE]
    x2b <- newdata[, pairs[, 2], drop = FALSE]
    
    if (interaction.type == "ratio") {
      x2 <- x2a/x2b
    } else {
      x2 <- x2a*x2b
    }
    
    colnames(x2) <- paste(colnames(x2a), colnames(x2b), sep = sep)
    
    if (filter) {
      keep <- DEGGs.object$keep[!is.na(DEGGs.object$keep)]
      x1 <- newdata[, keep]
      return(cbind(x1, x2))
    } else {
      return(cbind(newdata, x2))
    }
  }
  return(newdata)
}
```

Now you're ready to train your model with glmnet or any other model available 
in the `caret` package:

```r
library(nestedCV)

# Train a glmnet model
fitted_model <- nestcv.glmnet(
  y = metadata_vector, 
  x = assayData,
  filterFUN = NULL,
  filter_options = list(nfilter = 20),
  family = "binomial",
  alphaSet = seq(0.7, 1, 0.1),
  min_1se = 0,
  cv.cores = 1,
  modifyX_useY = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)

# Train a random forest model
fitted_model <- nestcv.train(
  y = metadata_vector,
  x = assayData,
  method = "rf",
  n_outer_folds = 8,
  modifyX = "DEGGs_ttest_modxy",
  filter_options = list(nfilter = 20),
  modifyX_useY = TRUE,
  cv.cores = 4, 
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

The ROC curve can be easily plotted: 

```r
plot(fitted_model$roc, col = 'red')
```

## Session Info

```{r}
