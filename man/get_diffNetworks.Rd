\arguments{
\item{assayData}{a matrix or data.frame (or list of matrices or data.frames
for multi-omic analysis) containing normalised assay data.
Sample IDs must be in columns and probe IDs (genes, proteins...) in rows.
For multi omic analysis, it is highly recommended to use a named list of data.
If unnamed, sequential names (assayData1, assayData2, etc.) will be
assigned to identify each matrix or data.frame.}

\item{metadata}{a named vector, matrix, or data.frame containing sample
annotations or categories. If matrix or data.frame, each row should
correspond to a sample, with columns representing different sample
characteristics (e.g., treatment group, condition, time point). The colname
of the sample characteristic to be used for differential analysis must be
specified in \code{category_variable}. Rownames must match the sample IDs used in
assayData.
If named vector, each element must correspond to a sample characteristic to
be used for differential andlysis, and names must match sample IDs used in
the colnames of \code{assayData}.
Continuous variables are not allowed.}

\item{category_variable}{when metadata is a matrix or data.frame this is the
column name of \code{metadata} that contains the sample annotations to be used for
differential analysis}

\item{regression_method}{whether to use robust linear modelling to calculate
link p values. Options are 'lm' (default) or 'rlm'. The lm implementation
is faster and lighter.}

\item{category_subset}{optional character vector indicating a subset of
categories from the category variable. If not specified, all categories in
\code{category_variable} will be used.}

\item{network}{network of biological interactions provided by the user. The
network must be provided in the form of a table of class data.frame with only
two columns named "from" and "to".
If NULL (default) a network of 10,537 molecular interactions obtained from
KEGG, mirTARbase, miRecords and transmiR will be used.
This has been obtained via the \code{exportgraph} function of the MITHrIL tool
(Alaimo et al., 2016).}

\item{percentile_vector}{a numeric vector specifying the percentiles to be
used in the percolation analysis. By default, it is defined as
\code{seq(0.35, 0.98, by = 0.05)}, which generates a sequence of percentiles
starting at 0.35, meaning that targets (genes/proteins...) whose expression
value is under the 35th percentile of the whole matrix will be excluded.
This threshold can be modified by specifying a different starting point for
\code{seq}. For a more granular percolation analysis an higher optimisation of
the algorithm, \code{by = 0.05} can be modified in favour of lower values, but
this will increase the computatinal time.}

\item{use_qvalues}{whether to use Storey's q values for multiple test
adjustment. If FALSE (default), unadjusted p values will be used and shown
in the output.}

\item{cores}{number of cores to use for parallelisation.}
}
\value{
a \code{deggs} object containing differential networks incorporating
p values or adjusted p values for each link.
