\title{Tidying up of metadata. Samples belonging to undesidered categories
(if specified) will be removed as well as categories with less than five
samples, and NAs.}
\usage{
tidy_metadata(
  category_subset = NULL,
  metadata,
  category_variable = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{category_subset}{optional character vector indicating which categories
are used for comparison. If not specified, all categories in
\code{category_variable} will be used.}

\item{metadata}{a named vector, matrix, or data.frame containing sample
annotations or categories. If matrix or data.frame, each row should
correspond to a sample, with columns representing different sample
characteristics (e.g., treatment group, condition, time point). The colname
of the sample characteristic to be used for differential analysis must be
specified in \code{category_variable}. Rownames must match the sample IDs used in
assayData.
If named vector, each element must correspond to a sample characteristic to
be used for differential analysis, and names must match sample IDs used in
the colnames of \code{assayData}.
Continuous variables are not allowed.}

\item{category_variable}{column name in \code{metadata} (if data.frame or matrix)
or NULL if \code{metadata} is already a named vector containing category
information.}
}
\value{
a tidy named factor vector of sample annotations.
